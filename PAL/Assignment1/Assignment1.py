# Write a program to create a customer’s bill for a company. The company sells only five
# different products: TV, VCR, Remote Controller, CD Player and Tape Recorder. The unit
# prices are $400.00, $220, $35.20, $300.00, and $150.00, respectively. The program must
# read the quantity of each piece of equipment purchased from the keyboard. It then
# calculates the cost of each item, the subtotal, and the total cost after an 8.25% sales tax.
# The input data consist of a set of integers representing the quantities of each item sold.
# These integers must be input into the program in a user friendly way; that is, the program
# must prompt the user for each quantity as shown below. The numbers in boldface show
# the user’s answers.
#
#     • How Many TVs Were Sold? 3
#     • How Many VCRs Were Sold? 5
#     • How Many Remote Controllers Were Sold? 1
#     • How Many CDs Were Sold? 2
#     • How Many Tape Recorders Were Sold? 4
#
# The format for the output from the program follows:
#
#   QTY     DESCRIPTION         UNIT PRICE      TOTAL PRICE
#   ---     -----------         ----------      -----------
#   XX      TV                  400.00            XXXX.XX
#   XX      VCR                 220.00            XXXX.XX
#   XX      REMOTE CTRLR         35.20            XXXX.XX
#   XX      CD PLAYER           300.00            XXXX.XX
#   XX      TAPE RECORDER       150.00            XXXX.XX
#                                                 ---------
#                               SUBTOTAL          XXXXX.XX
#                               TAX                XXXX.XX
#                               TOTAL             XXXXX.XX
